## 1. Startup Specification Deliverable

### What I Learned

**Elevator Pitch Structure**
- Context: what problem exists
- Pain: why it's frustrating
- Solution: how your app fixes it
- Keep it to one paragraph

**Planning a Web App**
- Map features to required technologies before coding
- HTML pages: 3-4 pages for simple apps (login, dashboard, content views)
- React SPA: Multiple views, but only ONE actual HTML file - React swaps components
- Always include all 6 technologies: HTML, CSS, React, Service (with 3rd party API), DB/Login, WebSocket

**Git Commands**
- `git push -u origin main` - sets up tracking FIRST time
- `git push` - works after tracking is set (cloned repos already tracked)

**Design Process**
1. Create wireframes first
2. Plan color scheme that doesn't distract from content
3. Keep UI minimal and functional

**Markdown Images**

**Key Insight**: Plan the technology stack early to avoid realizing you forgot a requirement halfway through.
